# Task Manager

## Introduction

This is a simple task manager application built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It allows users to add tasks, descriptions, and assignees.


## Technologies Used

- TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language
- HTML: the markup language used to structure the content of web pages
- CSS: the language used to style web pages
- OOP: a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes to organize code

## Key Features

- Add tasks with name, description, and assigned person count
- View existing tasks
- Move tasks from the "New" section to the "Finished" section when they are completed, and vice versa.

## Future Improvements

- Add the ability to delete tasks
- Allow users to edit existing tasks
- Implement advance drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging tasks

### Acknowledgements

This project was built as a learning exercise and was inspired by various tutorials and examples found online.

##  Conclusion

The Task Manager is a simple but functional application that demonstrates the use of TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and object-oriented programming principles. It can be used as a starting point for building more complex task management applications.
